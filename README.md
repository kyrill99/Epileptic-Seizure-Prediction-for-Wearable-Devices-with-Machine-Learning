# Epileptic Seizure Prediction for Wearable Devices with Deep Learning

This project, part of a semesterthesis at ETH Zurich, explores a lightweight, energy-efficient approach to real-time epileptic seizure prediction using EEG (Electroencephalography) data. Unlike state-of-the-art models that rely on large neural networks and dense EEG montages, this work focuses on a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for wearable, low-power applications.
